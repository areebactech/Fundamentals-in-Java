📘 **Fundamentals-in-Java**

Welcome to the Fundamentals-in-Java repository!

This project contains Java programs developed as part of programming fundamentals lab work. Each folder represents a lab session, including solutions to a variety of beginner-level tasks and problems.

📂 **Repository Structure**

The repository is organized into 5 lab folders, with each folder containing:

🔹 5 to 9 Lab Activities: These are tasks performed during the lab sessions, focusing on core Java concepts such as loops, conditions, sequences, and patterns.

🔹 10 Self-Solved Tasks: These are additional challenges solved independently to reinforce the concepts learned in each lab.

📝 **Lab Folders**

Lab 1:

🚀 Introduction to basic syntax

📝 Variables, data types, and operators

🔄 Simple conditionals and loops

Lab 2:

🔀 Nested loops and patterns

🧠 Conditional statements

🛠️ Introduction to methods

Lab 3:

🔢 Array manipulation
